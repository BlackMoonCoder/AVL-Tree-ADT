# CSC-3102-Project03
In this project I augment the implementation of a parametric extensible AVL tree ADT (abstract data type). I wrote a program that instantiates an AVL tree to store strings. The program, called Dendrologist, takes the order-code and name of a command-file as command line arguments and executes the intructions in the file while performing a trace of the instructions as they are executed. the order-codes corespond their respective orderings: 0 is ordered by increasing string length, primary key, and reverse lexigraphical order, secondary key, -1 is reverse lexigraphical order, 1 is lexigraphical order, -2 is decreasing string length, 2 is increasing string length, -3 is decreasing string length, primary key, and reverse lexigraphical order, secondary key, and 3 is increasing string length, primary key, and lexigraphical order, secondary key.
